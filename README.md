# ⚡️ Faísca - The modern LLM stack in 1000 lines of code

Faísca is a small uv script, without any dependencies, that implements the "modern" LLM stack in about 1000 lines of code. It includes:


- Pre-training a GPT model from scratch 
- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
- Reinforcement learning with [GRPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_gradient_method#Group_Relative_Policy_Optimization_(GRPO))







## TODO 

- [ ] Make MLX version of the script
- [ ] Make uv-script for main scripts and delete the rest 
- [ ] Clean up repo with old scripts, etc
- [ ] Details to README (description, inspiration)
- [ ] Add images to README 
- [ ] Write short article
